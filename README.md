This is a **multi featured** Open Source discord bot made by Curcit! It is currently in beta but it provides the following commands so far: 
+ Tickets 
+ Help command
+ Command handler
+ Aliases
+ User and Server info commands
+ Gets updated frequently.

Have fun! Please give me credit if you use the source code!

**Read the instructions folder on how to use the bot.**

Just a reminder you need node v12.18.4 for the bot to work **properly**
